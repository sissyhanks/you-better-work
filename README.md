## Description

This app is for users who want to keep track of their workday schedule. The header displays the current date, and the user can quickly assess where they are in their day by the hourly rows that change color to indicate hours that have passed, the current hour, and the hours remaining in the workday. Users can customize their calendars by making and saving upcoming tasks and events during each hour block. Saved entries will persist and be displayed anytime the user returns to the page.

With this project, I learned that I can meet my need for self-expression by developing and executing a detailed plan for solving the problem at hand. I also kept in mind that I may have ideas to make a project better that are not a part of the project's design. To sate my desire to do more, I focused on leaving my code in a state that could easily be altered or added on to when and if further development is pursued.
